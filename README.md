###  Travel Website(PHP BASED)


### 🌐 Travel Explorer — Discover, Dream, Explore

Welcome to *Travel Explorer, a beautifully crafted dynamic travel website that invites users to explore exotic destinations across the globe. Built with the power of PHP, styled gracefully with Bootstrap, and supported by a **MySQL* database, this project blends simplicity, interactivity, and design into one seamless experience.

Whether it's the cherry blossoms of Japan, the iconic Eiffel Tower in France, or the majestic Taj Mahal in India — users can easily select a destination, view captivating visuals, read brief descriptions, and get in touch through a smart enquiry form.


### ✨ Why This Project Stands Out

* 🗺 *Dynamic Content:* Choose a country and instantly view tailored content and visuals.
* 🎞 *Bootstrap Carousel:* Image sliders offer a cinematic preview of each destination.
* 💬 *Smart Contact Form:* Collect user enquiries and store them securely in a database.
* 💻 *Fully Responsive:* Clean, mobile-friendly layout using Bootstrap 5.
* 🛠 *Real Backend Integration:* PHP handles logic, MySQL stores user inputs.
